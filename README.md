# udacity-mle-starbucks-capstone-project
The capstone project for Udacity's machine learning engineer (MLE) nanodegree program.

## Project Overview

The object of this capstone project is to answer two business challenges using the Starbucks dataset:
* Can we use data to build a predictive model to determine whether a customer will view and complete a promotional offer based on the offer characteristics and customer demographic information?
* Can we use offer characteristics and customer demographic data to predict how much revenue a completed offer will generate after subtracting reward costs?

I analyze five different machine learning (ML) predictive model solutions and compare their performance for three case studies. These predictive models allow the business to personalize the characteristics of each promotional offer based on each customerâ€™s demographic profile to maximize the probability that the customer views and completes a promotional offer. Additionally, the regression model predicts how much revenue a completed promotional offer generates after subtracting the reward cost to help the business maximize return on investment (ROI) per customer. 

See the [project report](https://github.com/jman4162/udacity-mle-starbucks-capstone-project/blob/main/HodgeJohn_Udacity_MLE_Capstone_Report_v1.pdf) for a detailed write-up and analysis.

## Conclusions

Overall, this project was surprisingly challenging due to the structure of the `transcript.json` dataset and the preprocessing required to generate useful ML model predictions. However, I learned a lot in this project and developed solutions to the challenges discussed in the project proposal:
* Developed predictive ML models to classify whether views and completes a promotional offer based on personalized customer and offer characteristics
* Developed predictive ML models to determine how much a customer spends by completing an offer after subtracting out the reward cost. The ML predictive model outperforms the benchmark model in each of our three studies, and the benchmark models also perform pretty well.
* Determined the features that are most significant to whether or not a customer views and completes a promotional offer
* Defined key customer segment groups based on customer demographics

The models and insights developed in this project allow the company to understand the primary drivers of an effective and profitable promotional offer. The predictive models will enable the company to personalize the characteristics of each promotion to maximize its odds of success for each customer. This project is an excellent example of how machine learning models benefit marketing campaigns and create business value. Lastly, this project shows why a more efficient and straightforward machine learning model is often preferable to a larger and more complex deep learning model.
