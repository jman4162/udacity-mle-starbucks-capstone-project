# udacity-mle-starbucks-capstone-project
The capstone project for Udacity's machine learning engineer (MLE) nanodegree program.

## Project Overview

The object of this capstone project is to answer two business challenges using the Starbucks dataset:
* Can we use data to build a predictive model to determine whether a customer will view and complete a promotional offer based on the offer characteristics and customer demographic information?
* Can we use offer characteristics and customer demographic data to predict how much revenue a completed offer will generate after subtracting reward costs?

I analyze five different machine learning (ML) predictive model solutions and compare their performance for three case studies. These predictive models allow the business to personalize the characteristics of each promotional offer based on each customerâ€™s demographic profile to maximize the probability that the customer views and completes a promotional offer. Additionally, the regression model predicts how much revenue a completed promotional offer generates after subtracting the reward cost to help the business maximize return on investment (ROI) per customer.
